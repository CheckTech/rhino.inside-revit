title: Analytical Model Manipulation
---

{% include ltr/en/wip_note.html %}

This sample reviews ways that Rhino and Grasshopper can be used to manipulate the Revit Analytical model in Revit.

It seems that engineers are constantly mixing and matching information from multiple sources to do analysis.  Use Rhino and Grasshopper to collect information from multiple sources to dynamically bring the information together for analysis.

## Open Sample files:
1. Open the standard *rst_basic_sample_project.rvt* in Revit.
2. Start Rhino.Inside.Revit and open Rhino and the Grasshopper file [structural_revit_to_rhino.gh]({{ "/static/samples/structural_revit_to_rhino.gh" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) file.

The component covered in this sample:
1. Analytical Category picker
1. Simplify Curve component
1. Set Parameter on Revit Element
1. [Karamba Grasshopper plugin](https://www.karamba3d.com/)
