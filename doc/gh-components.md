# Grasshopper components for Revit
The Rhino InsideÂ® technology allows Rhino and Grasshopper to be embedded within Revit.

It is important to have a basic understanding to the [Revit Data Hierarchy](https://www.modelical.com/en/gdocs/revit-data-hierarchy/) of Category -> Family -> Type -> Instance/Element to create and select elements.

This guide documents the Grasshopper components that support Revit interaction.

## Components

#### Build Components

 | Icon | Name | Description |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-beambycurve.jpg) | Beam By Curve | Create a Revit Beam Object using a 2d or 3d curve for an axis |
 | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-floorbycurve.jpg) | Floor By Curve | Create a Revit Floor Object using a 2d curve |
 | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-columnbycurve.jpg) | Column By Curve | Create a Revit Column Object using an axial curve|
 | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-wallbycurve.jpg) | Wall By Curve | Create a Revit Wall Object using a plan curve|
 | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-directshape.jpg) | DirectShape | Create a Directshape Element using a plan curve. This is the most generic way to import Geometry. |
 | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-directshapecategory.jpg) | DirectShape Category | Create a Directshape category For using with the DirectShape Component |

#### Category Components

  | Icon | Name | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-categorydecompose.jpg) | Category Decompose | Break a Revit Category into its component parts.  Name, Parent, Line-Color, Material, Allow Bounds and Material Quantities |
  | ![Rhino sending geometry to Revit](gh-categorydecompose.jpg) | Category | Revit Category Param used for selecting persistent Category (future)|
